      <ul>
	<li><h3>Smart choices that make sense in the long run.</h3>
	  <p>We previously had a pretty website that we made out of a template we found online to which we added more functionalities as we saw fit. But during this process we came face to face with the situation of not knowing why certain parts of the site behaved in a certain way. We'd figure it out in due time but the process was very time consuming. The reason was simple, we didn't know our own website well enough. Using templates is pretty common these days. I've see myself or others strugling to find out why the site (which was just a modified version of a template they aquired from somehwere) was behaving the way it did. In light of these experiences we have decieded to build our website from scratch and to continue working on this website and improving it coninuously in between our busy college schedules and personal projects.</p></li>
	<li><h3>The Spirit of the Free Software Movement</h3>
	  <p> I also feel like I'm just postponing an oppurtunity to learn new things and improve my skills. The whole purpose of Free Software is users being aware of their code and taking control ove it. How can we stay true to this if all we are doing is blindly copy/pasting code without caring what is in it so long as the website looks good. Again we'll be making the same mistake of choosing comfort over the struggle which will benefit everyone in the future</p>
	  <p>This obviously does not apply to all cases. There are times when a template simply is enough or when a template is simply the only viable option in a given time frame. I'm also not blindly classifying copy pasting code as a sin. I'm just simply suggesting that blindly copy pasting code without knowing what it does shouldn't be encouraged.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Better Code = Better World</h3>
	  <p>I've also come to the realization that number of lines of code doesn't mean anything. As in any language it's always better to use just the right amount of words to express your thoughts anything more is a wastage of resources. What's really important is the quality of code. To quote the suckless manifest:<br><q><i>Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.</i></q></p></ul>
