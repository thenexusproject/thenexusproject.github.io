	  <h2>What is Free Software</h2>
	</header>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.</p>
	  To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.<br><b>A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:</b>

	     <li><h3>Freedom 1</h3>
	       <p>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li>
		  <li><h3>Freedom 2</h3>
		    <p>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li>
		    <li><h3>Freedom 3</h3>
		      <p>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li></ul>

	    <h2>Why we're not a GNU/Linux User Group.</h2>
	  </header>
	  <p>Many people adopt and use GNU/Linux purely on the basis of technical and cost criteria, without any appreciation for the underlying message of software freedom. We feel that describing ourselves as a Free Software User Group rather than a GNU/Linux User Group will contribute to a better appreciation of that underlying message. Also, the free software cause is much bigger than any one operating system. Besides the fact that GNU/Linux is not the only free operating system today (our group welcomes users of other free operating systems too), one must also appreciate the fact that in the fast changing world of computer science and operating systems technology, no operating system or kernel is eternal. The message of software freedom, however, is<br><sub>adopted from <a href="http://alpy.ilug.org.in/#two">here</a></sub></p>

	    <h2>Our Communities</h2>
	  </header>
	  <p>Community education, also known as community-based education or community learning & development, is an organization's programs to promote learning and social development work with individuals and groups in their communities using a range of formal and informal methods. A common defining feature is that programmes and activities are developed in dialogue with communities and participants. The purpose of community learning and development is to develop the capacity of individuals and groups of all ages through their actions, the capacity of communities, to improve their quality of life. Central to this is their ability to participate in democratic processes.</p>
