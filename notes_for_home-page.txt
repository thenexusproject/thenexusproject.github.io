Welcome to The Nexus community, we expect to bring together students and developers from different backgrounds and organizations to share their learnings and passion with each other, to motivate one another understand the importance of leveling up their skills through peer-to-peer learning and team building. 

Nobody can work alone and stay motivated for long, working alone and being able to achieve success is a rarity and is solitary, but with a team you can learn while having fun, competition and excitement, you get to meet great minds and connect with numerous unique individuals that share your enthusiasm which helps you stay motivated for the longest and help nurture your skills helping others and getting help from them in return. 

In this community we strive to do just that, peer-to-peer learning and teaching, so that you feel at rest and at ease while learning this advanced topic which might seem intimidating at first glance but becomes really fun and enjoyable to learn with your peers.
